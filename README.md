# HandWritten Number Recognize

two part of this project:

- train LeNet-5 model with tensorflow-gpu 1.13.1 under windows 10, saving trained model as pb type file(using python)
- write recognizing program under Ubuntu, in which the trained model is loaded with OpenCV_dnn module,and build program with Cmake(using C++)

the final achievement is an executable program under Ubuntu, which can be used to recognize handwritten number.

## System information(version)

- Operating System / Platform => Ubuntu 16.04 + windows 10
- OpenCV => 3.4.1
- Python => 3.5.2
- Tensorflow => 1.13.1
- Compiler => GCC 5.4.0
